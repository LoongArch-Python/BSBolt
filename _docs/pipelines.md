## Analysis Pipelines 

### Adapter Trimming 

It is good practice to trim adapter sequences from sequencing reads before alignment with BSBolt. We recommend using 
[CutAdapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 


### Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing

### Targeted Bisulfite Seuquencing

### Reduced Representative Bisulfite Sequencing

### Read Simulation
